# Modelica district heating optimization MPC
This is a Modelica package for district heating and building heating systems modelling, optimization and control. The main contribution of this package are:
1) A fast and effective approach to model and optimize district heating and building heating systems;
2) Year-level measured data for a campus district heating system and a university building in Norway is opened for testing and research.

The package includes the following parts:
1) Package for MPC of building heating systems, MPC building heating system. This fold includes the Modelica model, JModelica code and measured data for a university building in Norway.  
2) Package for optimizing district heating systems, Optimization DH system. This fold includes the Modelica model, JModelica code and measured data for a university campus district heating system in Norway.
3) Package for MPC district heating systems, MPC DH system. This fold includes the Modelica model, JModelica code and measured data for a university campus district heating system in Norway.

The package is developed by Haoran Li and Juan Hou during their study at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU).
